## Project Overview ##
Airline companies aim to enhance customer satisfaction by identifying key factors that contribute to positive feedback. This project involves exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and the use of machine learning classifiers to predict customer satisfaction.
## Dataset ##
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to customer satisfaction. Load the dataset (e.g., Airline_customer_satisfaction.csv) in the same directory as the notebook or specify the file path in the data loading section.

## Data Preprocessing ##
Data preprocessing steps include:

- Cleaning and handling missing values.
- Scaling and encoding features as necessary.
- Exploratory analysis using customized visualizations.
## Model Training and Evaluation ##
Several machine learning classifiers were used to predict customer satisfaction, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost Classifier
The models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

## Results ##
The notebook provides insights into feature importance and model performance. Each model's evaluation metrics are included to compare accuracy and effectiveness in predicting customer satisfaction.

## Contributing ##
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the analysis or add new models.
